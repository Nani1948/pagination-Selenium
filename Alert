/*1.In Selenium or general web automation, there are three main types of alerts (also known as pop-ups or JavaScript alerts) that you may encounter:
		 * 1. Simple Alert or JavaScript
                A simple alert contains only an OK button.
                It is typically used for displaying information or warnings.
		 *            Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
                      alert.accept(); // Clicks OK

		 * 2. Confirmation Alert
                 A confirmation alert contains OK and Cancel buttons.
                 It is used to confirm an action (e.g., deleting an item).
		 *                Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
                          alert.accept(); // Clicks OK
                           alert.dismiss(); // Clicks Cancel
                3. Prompt Alert: it contains two or one input box
		 *           A prompt alert contains a text box, along with OK and Cancel buttons.
                 It is used when user input is required (e.g., entering a name).
                  Example: prompt("Please enter your name:");
                 Handling in Selenium:
		 *      Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
               alert.sendKeys("Test User"); // Enters text
               alert.accept(); // Clicks OK
Note:
		 Verify the alert is present or not using WebDriverWait.
isDisplayed or isEnabled or is isSelected is applicable to check whether the webelement is present or not.
		 //isDisplayed or isEnabled or is isSelected is applicable for all the webelement but not for the alert.


 Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
alert.accept();//close alert box using ok button
 alert1.sendKeys()//pass the text into input box
alert.getText();capture the text value from the alert
alert.dismiss();close alert box using cancel button
